    "        #pros - pretty granular\n",
    "        #cons - assumption on 70% reviews left becomes a compounding error - maybe take the lower 20th percentile of times between reviews\n",
    "    # simply using minimum stay time (not accurate, but I'm thinking this can be combined with something else)\n",
    "        #pros - easy and consistent between listings\n",
    "        #cons - listings with monthly min stay get overvalued and short stay undervalued\n",
    "    # use the calendar to determine a stay length metric using recent bookings (will be way off - see cons)\n",
    "        #pros - at first thought seems the most accurate\n",
    "        #cons - second thought: if bookings are back to back, there's no way to know they're 2 seperate bookings and accuracy will be way off\n",
    "    # use combined calendar + reviews to identify split between back to back bookings (lots of assumptions - see cons)\n",
    "        #pros - could theorhetically be the most accurate\n",
    "        #cons - extremely complex and people who didn't leave reviews will massively hinder accuracy\n",
    "                # assumes reviews were actaully left in a timely manner\n",
    "    # don't even use review data and use reviews_per_month and minimum_stay length to try determine a booking rate (esentailly the combination of 1 + 2, easy to do, probably our best bet)\n",
    "        #pros - easyto implement: all calculations can be done with listings.csv\n",
    "        #cons - hardest to verify accuracy"
