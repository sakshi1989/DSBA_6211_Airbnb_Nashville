    "    # simply using minimum stay time (not accurate, but I'm thinking this can be combined with something else)\n",

    "    # use the calendar to determine a stay length metric using recent bookings (will be way off - see cons)\n",

    "    # use combined calendar + reviews to identify split between back to back bookings (lots of assumptions - see cons)\n",
    "        #pros - could theorhetically be the most accurate\n",
    "        #cons - extremely complex and people who didn't leave reviews will massively hinder accuracy\n",
    "                # assumes reviews were actaully left in a timely manner\n",
    "    # don't even use review data and use reviews_per_month and minimum_stay length to try determine a booking rate (esentailly the combination of 1 + 2, easy to do, probably our best bet)\n",
